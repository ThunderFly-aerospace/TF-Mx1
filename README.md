# Thunderfly Multicopters
Multicopter UAVs.


## Water-jet fire-fighting multicopter 

The multicopter uses high-pressure water source connected to multicopter by high-pressure hose. The multiple pulse modulated velves at multicopter arms are used for controlled ejetion of water. The water nozzles produces lift which allows the multicopter to fly. 
The ejecting water cools down the multitopter systems and improving safety.
